This repository contains a game based on [LÖVE](https://love2d.org/) I've been developing to play a little with Lua.
The game itself is an awful version of [Rodent's Revenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodent%27s_Revenge) that I used
to play and enjoy when I was little.

In order to run this game from the sources you need to install LÖVE first, then you can run
```shell
love src
```
from the root folder.

There are some configurations for the game available in [config.lua](src/config.lua).
